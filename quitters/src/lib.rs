#![forbid(unsafe_code)]

//! Obtains the dependency list from a compiled Rust binary by parsing its panic messages.
//! Recovers both crate names and versions.
//!
//! ## Caveats
//!  * If the crate never panics, it will not show up.
//!    The Rust compiler is very good at removing unreachable panics,
//!    so we can only discover at around a half of all dependencies.
//!  * C code such as `openssl-src` never shows up, because it can't panic.
//!  * Only crates installed from a registry are discovered. Crates from local workspace or git don't show up.
//!
//! # Alternatives
//! [`cargo auditable`](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-auditable) embeds the **complete** dependency information
//! into binaries, which can then be recovered using [`auditable-info`](https://crates.io/crates/auditable-info).
//! It should be used instead of `quitters` whenever possible, unless you're specifically after panics.

// This regex works suprisingly well. We can even split the crate name and version reliably

// Versions like "1" are not valid in Cargo, or under the semver spec.

// Compiled regular expressions use interior mutability and may cause contention
// in heavily multi-threaded workloads. This should not be an issue here
// because we only use `.captures_iter()`, which acquires the mutable state
// only once per invocation and for a short amount of time:

// This could be refactored into cloning in case it *does* end up being a bottleneck in practice,
// which would sacrifice ergonomics.

    // You might think that just making two functions, versions_unix and versions_windows
    // and then calling the appropriate function for your platform would be faster,
    // since \ paths cannot be used on Unix. I briefly thought so!
    // However, cross-compilation from Windows to Unix would put \ paths into a Unix binary.
    // So that optimization would miss cross-compiled binaries.
    // It only gets you a 20% reduction in runtime because the I/O dominates anyway.
    //
    // A significant optimization to tackle the I/O problem would be only ever reading things
    // into the CPU cache as opposed to loading the entire file to memory.
    // Basically streaming the data. This requires special handling of the start and end,
    // so either needs a state-machine-based parser like nom or capping the possible match length.
    // The latter is doable but only makes sense if it turns out that the current approach is too slow.
