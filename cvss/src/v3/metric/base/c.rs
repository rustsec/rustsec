/// Confidentiality Impact (C) - CVSS v3.1 Base Metric Group

/// Described in CVSS v3.1 Specification: Section 2.3.1:
/// <https://www.first.org/cvss/specification-document#t6>
///
/// > This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information
/// > resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited
/// > vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and
/// > disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or
/// > disclosure to, unauthorized ones. The Base Score is greatest when the loss
/// > to the impacted component is highest.

    /// > There is some loss of confidentiality. Access to some restricted
    /// > information is obtained, but the attacker does not have control over
