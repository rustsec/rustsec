/// <https://www.first.org/cvss/specification-document#t6>
///
/// > This metric captures the requirement for a human user, other than the
/// > attacker, to participate in the successful compromise of the vulnerable
/// > component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be
/// > exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user

/// > The Base Score is greatest when no user interaction is required.
