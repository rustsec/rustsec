/// Described in CVSS v2.0 Specification: Section 2.1.3:
/// <https://www.first.org/cvss/v2/guide#2-1-3-Authentication-Au>
///
/// > This metric measures the number of times an attacker must authenticate to
/// > a target in order to exploit a vulnerability. This metric does not gauge
/// > the strength or complexity of the authentication process, only that an
/// > attacker is required to provide credentials before an exploit may occur.
/// > The possible values for this metric are listed in Table 3. The fewer
/// > authentication instances that are required, the higher the vulnerability
/// > score.
